# nguyenkevin-dotcom-Production-of-an-animated-episode
A small database project that I design and implement on the educational Oracle server kit-oracle.vse.cz.

This semester project is devoted to a data modeling example designed to provide basic insight and solutions to the most common types of relationships in reality.

This repository consists of only the documentation of my project.

The project documentation is in CZECH language.
